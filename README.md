A simple home made project replacing my (unfortunately) defect LaMetric clock.

Code to display a LaMetric-like display on Raspberry Pi.
Configured for 1024x600 px (WindShare 7inch DCI)

Output text is German/metric
Birthday list has to be entered.
Holidays have to be adapted to your local requirements.

lametric-font has been creaded by me.
gif files have been created by me.

Everything is free to use.
